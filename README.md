# real-time_object_detection

our realtime object detection uses yolov8s model.

***YOLOv8*** is a computer vision model architecture developed by Ultralytics, the creators of ***YOLOv5***. You can deploy ***YOLOv8*** models on a wide range of devices, including **NVIDIA Jetson, NVIDIA GPUs, and macOS systems with Roboflow Inference**, an open source Python package for running vision models.

YOLOv8 model comes in 5 different sizes 

   |------------|---------------------| 
   |1.YOLOv8n   | nano model in yolo. |
   |            |                     |
   | 2.YOLOv8s  |  small model.       |
   |            |                     |
   | 3.YOLOv8m  |  medium model.      |
   |            |                     |
   | 4.YOLOv8l  |  large model.       |
   |            |                     |
   | 5.YOLOv8x  |  xtra large model.  |
   |------------|---------------------| 

for our projet we selected YOLOv8s model for optimal use cases and it uses less computational power to detect objects in the object detection project 
    the main goal of our project is to accurately detect and label our day to day objects in our surrondings.
